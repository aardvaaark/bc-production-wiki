# Podcast Workflow

## Overview:

Each week the raw teaching audio is recorded on the x32 console to a USB stick (named X32) as a `.wav` file. The file is automatically named based on the following convention: `R_YYYYMMDD-TIMESTAMP.wav`. This file is edited to trim excess before and after the message, mastered to noramlize audio and given automation to fade in/out. This file is exported as a .mp3. Next a new blog post is added on the Bright City squarespace website under /teaching. After the new blog post is published, an RSS feed is automatically created from the blog post. This RSS feed is then consumed by Spotify and Apple Podcasts. The one-time setup for the Bright City podcast has been done on those platforms pointing to our specific domain as the source of the epidose.
